## Client Use of the Project

- Client used the software in the Blue Ridge office on Will's machine.
- Features Tested
  - [FR25] User can access configurable settings through a menu on the step node.
  - [FR27] A sequence should have a drop down menu containing a selection of sequence types for the user to choose from.
  - [FR30] Upon clicking the icon to delete a configuration, the user will be prompted to confirm the deletion before the action occurs.
- He used the software for around 5 minutes
- Reaction
  - He seemed pretty satisfied with what was done but voiced higher expectations for features in this upcoming iteration.
  - He also wants us to user modals instead of using the built-in browser features.
- Recognized a few unusual things with the UI such as elements not fully displayed.
- Issues
  - Nodes weren't connected
  - A bug was found where you aren't able to perform the delete functionality without clicking the tab on top
  - The zoom controls weren't fully displayed. They were sort of cut off at the bottom of the screen.
  - When saving a configuration, hitting the "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons performed the same function.
