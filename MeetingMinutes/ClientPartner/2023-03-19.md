## Topics Discussed

- Current state of the project
  - Usability
    - really likes the beginning of the step system we've integrated
    - talked about its use for mocking and demonstrating to clients possible solutions to their PLC programming
    - Despite no database integration for steps, found it useful
  - Wants DB integration and couple UI cleanups

## Things Clarified

- Use modals instead of the built-in browser controls.
  - In progress, still.
- Verified who worked on which features
- Enjoyed the bug fixes and QOL features that were added.

## Client Use of the Project

- Client used the software in the Blue Ridge office on Will's machine.
- Features Tested
  - [FR21] Each sequence node should visually have a menu item to configure the steps and subsequences of that sequence [BR1][HIGH]
  - [FR22] Upon clicking the "configure steps" menu item, a modal will open containing the workspace for that specific sequence [BR1][HIGH]
  - [FR24] Each step has a pointer to another step or sequence [BR1][HIGH]
  - [FR26] The steps will be distinguished from each other through colors [BR2][MEDIUM]
  - [FR33] A user should be able to rename sequences and control modules [BR2][MEDIUM]
  - [FR34] A user should see a front page visual at the start of the application showing them that no configurations are open[BR2][MEDIUM]
- He used the software for around 5 minutes
- Reaction
  - He seemed pretty satisfied with what was done and appreciate dthe design of the steps system
  - Surprised with what we had done (in a good way)
  - Still found a couple UI QOL features to implement as well as some that did not get done
- Issues
  - Confirm modal, again
  - Couple step functionality changes to correct
