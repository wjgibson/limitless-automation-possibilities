I enjoyed hearing what others outside of the Computer Science realm thought about our project. Most were inquisitive but some were positive and others were negative. The negative ones were skeptical about automation in general which was a bit out of scope of the project but they were a little afraid of how it would affect the economy. The main thing I wanted to emphasize is the marginal product of utility where instead of doing the more repetitive tasks of programming a manufacturing process, they could be doing other things with their time that a computer would be unable to do. I now understand why computer science can be put at a disadvantage during the presentation as it is less clear about how the project improves society as a whole even though it can have sweeping industry impacts. Overall, I felt that presenting it had a positive impact on the idea of manufacturing automation on those who attended and brought the idea to a brighter light.

I went and saw other CS capstone projects. Some due to the CS 420 assignment requirement and some just out of curiosity. I noticed not surprisingly some key similarities between projects in how they are architecturally structured and the languages used. There were some differences in languages and frameworks used as they most likely fit into their project better. It was nice to show off the project to people and it didn’t feel like really bad work to show off. The detail of the other projects that were not CS-related looked better on average so it makes sense as to why CS doesn’t win.

My experience at the Student Symposium was a blast, but I did encounter some challenges. It was tough trying to explain the importance of the project to others, and I found myself wondering how to convey the meaningfulness of the project to others. Despite this, I had a great time exploring the symposium and seeing what other students had come up with, even those that weren't related to computer science. It was really cool to be able to walk around and chat with people about their projects, and it reminded me that I'm pretty good at talking to people. I also have to admit, it was pretty funny to see people's faces when we asked them to take a picture with us out of the blue! All in all, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about my communication and social skills.

My experience at the symposium was entertaining. We had a lot more people that stopped by than I thought we would. It felt really nice to show off the project and have some people actually show interest in it. One old man was against automation, worrying that “it’ll take our jobs”. He was kind of rude, but it gave us a good chance to explain that this tool doesn’t replace jobs. Overall, the symposium went a lot better than I thought and I got a lot of practice pitching LAP to people concisely.
