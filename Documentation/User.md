<h1>1: The Sidebar</h1>
<h2>This sidebar is interactable with 6 draggable items able to be dropped into area 4</h2>
<p>
The indicator for selection will not change when hovering over a sidebar item. For example, click to grab an Input Node and the click can be released anywhere to the left of the sidebar. Also for example, when this Input Node is dropped, it creates input node with a black dot to signify a potential connection. All 6 items follow the same logic.
</p>
